# ENG296_CapstoneProject

This project explores the relationship between NFL stadium surface conditions—specifically natural grass versus artificial turf—and running back (RB) workload, defined by the number of carries per game, to assess their combined impact on injury risk. At the heart of the study is a focused question: does the field condition (grass vs turf) and player workload interact in a way that meaningfully increases the likelihood of injuries for NFL running backs?
